        The non-parametric test does not require any population distribution, which is meant by distinct parameters.
         It is also a kind of hypothesis test, which is not based on the underlying hypothesis. In the case of the 
         non-parametric test, the test is based on the differences in the median. So this kind of test is also called 
         a distribution-free test. The test variables are determined on the nominal or ordinal level. If the independent
         variables are non-metric, the non-parametric test is usually performed.

        The t-statistic test holds on the underlying hypothesis, which includes the normal distribution of a variable. 
        In this case, the mean is known, or it is considered to be known. For finding the sample from the population, 
        population variance is identified. It is hypothesized that the variables of concern in the population are estimated 
        on an interval scale.
