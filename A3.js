//When using var you can reassign and redeclare.
//When using let you can only reassign but one can not redeclare a value.
//When using const you can neither reassign nor redeclare a value.
//When you try to reassign a value with let it will execute the command and an output will be given.
//When you try to reassign a value with const it will bring an error because the value is a constant.
